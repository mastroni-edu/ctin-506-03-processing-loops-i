# Assignment 4: Loops I

## Assignment
Write code in Processing that draws a series of circles whenever the mouse is clicked. There should be a total of 5 circles: 2 to the left and 2 to the right of the mouse cursor. Final result should look like this [interactive example](http://peterbrinson.com/usc/Processing/loops1a/).

## Parameters
Solution must use a loop â€“ your answer should not have five separate calls to ellipse()

## Hints
Remember, for mousePressed() to work, you need to include the draw() function in your project even though draw() doesn't need to contain any code. This is true with all uses of mousePressed() in Processing.
