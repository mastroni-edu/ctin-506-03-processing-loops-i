# Assignment 4: Loops 1

## Assignment
a: Write code in Processing that draws a series of circles whenever the mouse is clicked. There should be a total of 5 circles: 2 to the left and 2 to the right of the mouse cursor. Final result should look like this [interactive example](http://peterbrinson.com/usc/Processing/loops1a/).

b: Write code in Processing that draws a series of three circles at random locations at a regular interval. Final result should look like this [interactive example](http://peterbrinson.com/usc/Processing/loops1b/).

## Parameters
Solution must use a loop â€“ your answer should have one call to ellipse() or circle() per code file.

## Hints
a: Remember, for mousePressed() to work, you need to include the draw() function in your project even though draw() doesn't need to contain any code. This is true with all uses of mousePressed() in Processing.
